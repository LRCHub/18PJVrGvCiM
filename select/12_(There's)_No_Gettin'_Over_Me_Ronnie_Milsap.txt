Well, you can walk out on me tonight
If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there ain't no gettin' over me

Well, you can say that you need to be free
But there ain't no place that I won't be
Sweet darling, there ain't no gettin' over me

I'll be the bill you forgot to pay
I'll be the dream that keeps you awake
I'll be the song on the radio
I'll be the reason that you tell the boys, "No"
Don't you know?

You can tell everyone that we're through
And you might even believe it too
But darling, there ain't no gettin' over me
Sweet darling, there ain't no gettin' over me

I'll be the face that you see in a crowd
And I'll be the times that you cry out loud
I'll be the smile when there's no one around
I'll be the book that you just can't put down

So you can walk out on me tonight
If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there ain't no gettin' over me
You'll see
Sweet darling, there ain't no gettin' over me

No, no, no, no, no, no darling
There ain't no gettin' over me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mmm-hmm
No darling, there ain't no gettin' over me, ooh
No darling, there ain't no gettin' over me
