# Lucky Daye – Over

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Every time we link up,
it's only us there
We're thinking,
will we get there?
Is it wrong? Is it right?
You know that I miss you
But I be getting mixed signals
Why you slow down?
Don't stop this green light
Now you calling me special
When you know I can't have you
When I'm on to the next one
Oh, now you wanna get aggressive
Ooh, fuck do you mean?
You keep on making believe
Nightmares turned into a dream
If you're so toxic to me,
what am I fiendin'?
'Cause I thought it was over
Got me thinking my feelings over
You keep doing it over and over
You keep calling me back
I'm just tryna get closure
But you're pulling me closer
and closer
Phone ringing like over and over
'Cause you keep calling me back
Why you keep calling me back?
Back
Love me then you switch up
I'd rather we never pick up
But can we slip up and mix up
sometimes?
You say you don't mean it
Just want it
when it's convenient
Am I crazy for waiting?
I might slide
Now you calling me special
When you know I can't have you
When I'm on to the next one
Oh, now you wanna get aggressive
Oh, fuck do you mean?
You keep on making believe
Nightmares turned into a dream
If you're so toxic to me,
what am I fiendin'?
'Cause I thought it was over
Got me thinking my feelings over
You keep doing it over and over
You keep calling me back
I'm just tryna get closure
But you're pulling me closer
and closer
Phone ringing like over and over
'Cause you keep calling me back
Why you keep calling me back?
Back
Now you walking on a thin line
We been through it like
ten times
I'ma put you in line
Yeah, I had you on a incline
Now I don't even want to reply
I'ma have to decline
Yeah, you showed me
I don't want to rewind
Yeah, know you a ten
but that attitude ain't fine
